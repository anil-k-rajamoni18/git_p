TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. It is basically a protocol that enables encrypted communication between browsers and web applications for which TLS is enabled. Any web application that is accessible over https has TLS enabled.



Does SSL use TLS?
Image result
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to SSL. TLS is an improved version of SSL. It works in much the same way as the SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information. The two terms are often used interchangeably in the industry although SSL is still widely used.

What is purpose of SSL certificate?
An SSL certificate is a bit of code on your web server that provides security for online communications. When a web browser contacts your secured website, the SSL certificate enables an encrypted connection. It's kind of like sealing a letter in an envelope before sending it through the mail.



http --- browser --- webserver => travel the data in plain text

http --- browser --encrypted text ----- > webserver

	- it will work based on SSL or TSL !
